## RFP 4 - Frogger-Playing Neural Network
This is all the work for the RFP 4 in my Data Science 2 class at Cherry Creek Innovation Campus.

## Goal
The main goal of this assignment is to make a neural network to play Frogger, and determine the best convolutional deep q-learning neural network architecture to do so.
